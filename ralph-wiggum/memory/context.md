# Project Context

> Fill in the sections below to help agents understand your project.

## Ralphus Structure

**CRITICAL**: All Ralphus files live under `ralph-wiggum/`:
- `ralph-wiggum/specs/` - Technical specifications
- `ralph-wiggum/prds/` - Product requirement docs
- `ralph-wiggum/memory/` - Shared context (this file)
- `ralph-wiggum/[variant]/` - Variant workspaces

**NEVER** create `specs/`, `prds/`, or `inbox/` at the project root.
