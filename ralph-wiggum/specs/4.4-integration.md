# Spec: Phase 4.4 - Integration

> **Goal**: Integrate the new Board components into the Application Sidebar.
> **Context**: Users need to see and manage their boards directly from the sidebar.

## 1. Requirements

### 1.1 App Sidebar Update
- **File**: `OpenKanban/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`
- **Logic**:
    - Use `useParams` to get `projectId`.
    - If `projectId` is present:
        - Call `useBoards(projectId)`.
        - Render a new `SidebarGroup` labeled "Project Boards" (below or separate from "Projects").
        - **Important**: Keep the "Projects" group visible (or collapsible) so users can switch projects.
- **Components**:
    - "Create Board" button in group action (uses `CreateBoardDialog`).
    - List of boards (SidebarMenu).
    - Each board item has `BoardActionsMenu`.
    - Active board item is highlighted.

### 1.2 Empty & Loading States
- **Loading**: Show `Skeleton` items (similar to Projects list).
- **Error**: Show "Failed to load boards" message.
- **Empty**: If `useBoards` returns empty list, show "No boards" placeholder in the sidebar group.

## 2. Definition of Done
- [ ] Sidebar shows "Project Boards" ONLY when inside a project.
- [ ] Boards list is filtered by the current project.
- [ ] Loading and Error states are handled gracefully.
- [ ] "Create Board" creates a board for the CURRENT project.
- [ ] Board navigation works.
- [ ] Deleting a board updates the list immediately.

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  Modify `app-sidebar.tsx`.
2.  Add conditional rendering based on `projectId`.
3.  Integrate `useBoards` hook.
4.  Render `SidebarGroup` with `CreateBoardDialog`.
5.  Render list with `BoardActionsMenu`.
6.  Manual Verification (as per Plan Section 4).
